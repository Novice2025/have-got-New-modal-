            <h2>Understanding "Just to give you a heads up"</h2>
            <p>
                "Just (to give you) a quick heads-up" is a casual, polite way to warn or inform someone about something in advance, usually when the news is small, unexpected, or could affect them. It's very common in workplaces, emails, chats, and conversations.
            </p>
            <p>
                It softens the message and shows consideration (“I’m telling you early so you’re not surprised”). Very natural in English-speaking workplaces and casual communication.
